# AI-Native Timer – Idea Brief

## Original Prompt  
> Suppose a timer app has not yet been invented. In a world where intelligence is abundant and on tap, what would the first-ever AI-native timer designed from the ground up look like and function?

---

## Summary  
We envision a phone-first timer that feels more like a knowledgeable assistant than a stopwatch. Users simply **say what they need** (“Start Norwegian 4 × 4” or “Kids-bedtime sprint at 8 PM weekdays”), and the app *builds, adjusts, runs, and logs* the appropriate sequence—quietly leveraging context (location, eventually health data) and staying invisible unless asked “why?”. Voice drives nearly every interaction; a minimalist drag-to-set clock and swipe gestures back it up when silence is required. The free version supports unlimited ad-hoc timers and one saved routine; a **one-time purchase (~ $3-4)** unlocks unlimited routines across all the user’s devices.

## Idea Brief  

### 1. Problem  
Conventional timers force users to juggle mental math (“2-min warm-up then 4× [4 min on / 3 min off]”), remember contextual tweaks (boiling eggs takes longer in Denver), and manually track multiple overlapping tasks. Even voice assistants only set blunt countdowns—they don’t *understand* routines.

### 2. Proposed Solution  
An **AI-native timer** that:
1. **Understands routines by name or description**  
   *“Start a Norwegian 4 × 4”* → auto-constructs warm-up, HIIT, recovery, repeats.  
2. **Creates new multi-step timers via free-form voice**  
   *“Create a kids-bedtime sprint: heads-up 10 min, shower 30 min, reading 15 min, quiet time 10 min at 8 PM weekdays.”*  
3. **Applies contextual intelligence silently**  
   Adjusts durations with altitude, global knowledge, later health metrics; explanation only on demand.  
4. **Runs multiple timers gracefully**  
   Stacked progress rings; spoken phase prompts include routine name only when >1 timer active; voice or single-tap pause/stop per ring.  
5. **Logs sessions privately on-device**  
   Syncs through native iCloud / Google mechanisms; roll-up per routine shows **streak | variance | last run**; weekly drill-down lists runs with start time, completion status, notes.  
6. **Scheduled auto-starts & overlaps**  
   Swipeable list to enable/disable each day; overlapping timers allowed.  
7. **Lightweight sharing**  
   System share sheet for email/text; optional template sharing library later.  

### 3. Value Proposition  
* **Zero mental overhead** – speak the goal, not the math.  
* **Context-smart** – silent altitude/knowledge adjustments mean perfectly boiled eggs or altitude-adjusted workouts without thinking.  
* **Habit intelligence** – streak + variance stats surface consistency at a glance.  
* **Own it forever** – one-time purchase (no subscription) unlocks unlimited routines across devices.  

### 4. MVP Scope (≈ 3 months)  
| Must-Have | Nice-to-Have (later) |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Voice creation & launch | Health-metric adjustments |
| Free-form routine authoring with AI name suggestion | Community template search/ratings |
| Silent drag-clock UI + swipe list | Strava/HealthKit exports |
| Location-based adjustments | Smart coaching tips |
| On-device logging & history | Wearable-only standalone mode |
| Stacked rings + voice/tap controls | Spatial gesture control |

### 5. Personas  
1. **Focused Achiever** – knowledge-worker using Pomodoro-style sprints. Wants frictionless setup, streak tracking.  
2. **Workout Enthusiast** – HIIT & endurance routines; values altitude/heart-rate tweaks and shareable logs.  
3. **Busy Parent** – chore & bedtime sequences; needs scheduled auto-starts and quick voice tweaks amid chaos.  

### 6. Business Model  
* **Free Tier:** unlimited ad-hoc timers + one saved routine.  
* **Unlock Forever ($3-4, Apple/Google Pay):** unlimited routines, scheduled auto-starts, multi-timer overlap management.  
* **Future Add-ons:** niche packs (advanced sports analytics, coach integrations) sold separately but never mandatory.

## FAQ (selected)  

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Why only one saved routine in free tier?** | Delivers real value while creating a natural “aha” moment when users want a second. |
| **Does the unlock cover watch/tablet/speaker versions?** | Yes—one purchase, all current & future devices. |
| **Will my data leave my phone?** | No, unless you explicitly share or export it. All logs sync via native encrypted services. |
| **How does the app know boiling-egg times?** | A curated knowledge base of common tasks + altitude formulae; we refine with usage data (opt-in). |
