## Review and Quality Assurance

This development plan provides a clear, incremental approach to building the AI-Native Timer MVP. Each weekly release builds on the previous one, delivering a working product that gradually incorporates all the features specified in the product requirements.

The plan adheres to the technical decisions and ADRs outlined in the system design document:
- Follows hybrid approach for natural language processing (ADR 1)
- Uses Core Data with iCloud sync for user data, SQLite for knowledge base (ADR 2)
- Implements direct API calls to LLM services without a dedicated backend (ADR 3)
- Integrates with Anthropic Claude API for NLP (ADR 4)
- Uses hybrid approach for background processing (ADR 5)
- Follows SwiftUI with MVVM architecture (ADR 6)
- Implements Core Data with NSPersistentCloudKitContainer for synchronization (ADR 7)

Each weekly release is scoped to be achievable within a single week by a team of two senior engineers working with AI Coding Assistants. The prompts are designed to be clear, specific, and to produce code that aligns with the architectural decisions from the system design document.

By following this plan, the team will be able to deliver a high-quality MVP of the AI-Native Timer app that implements all the required features while maintaining a sustainable development pace.
