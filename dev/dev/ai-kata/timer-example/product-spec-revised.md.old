# Product Specification Document: AI-Native Timer

## Introduction & Vision

The AI-Native Timer reimagines timers for the AI era. Rather than forcing users to manually configure timers with specific durations and steps, this application leverages natural language understanding and contextual intelligence to create a frictionless timing experience.

Our vision is to create a timer that feels like a knowledgeable assistant rather than a mechanical stopwatch. Users simply express their timing needs in natural language, and the app intelligently builds, adjusts, runs, and logs the appropriate sequences. The app quietly leverages contextual data (location, eventually health data) while staying invisible unless the user wants to understand what's happening beneath the surface.

The product's core value proposition is:
- **Zero mental overhead** – speak the goal, not the math
- **Context-smart** – silent contextual adjustments for perfect results without thinking
- **Habit intelligence** – streak and variance stats to surface consistency at a glance
- **Own it forever** – one-time purchase unlocks unlimited functionality across devices

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Create a timer application that reduces cognitive load through natural language understanding
2. Leverage contextual intelligence to improve timer accuracy without user configuration
3. Support complex multi-step routines that previously required mental math or multiple timers
4. Enable habit formation through intelligent logging and streak tracking
5. Provide a business model that prioritizes user value over recurring revenue

### MVP Objectives
1. Deliver core voice-driven timer creation and management
2. Implement free-form routine authoring with name suggestions
3. Build a minimalist visual interface with drag-to-set clock and swipe gestures
4. Integrate location-based adjustments for common activities
5. Create on-device logging and history visualization
6. Implement stacked timer visualization with simple controls
7. Launch with a clear free tier and one-time purchase upgrade path

## Open Questions and Assumptions

### Open Questions
1. **Privacy vs. Functionality**: How do we balance cloud-based LLM processing with user privacy expectations?
2. **Knowledge Base Evolution**: What's the best approach to implementing dynamic knowledge base updates independent of app updates?
3. **Context Permissions**: How aggressively should we request location/health permissions that enable contextual intelligence?
4. **Voice Feedback**: What's the right balance of voice feedback to avoid both confusion and annoyance?
5. **Platform Extensions**: When is the right time to expand beyond iOS to Android and wearable platforms?
6. **LLM Cost Management**: How do we optimize cloud-based LLM usage to maintain reasonable operating costs?

### Assumptions
1. Users will overwhelmingly prefer voice input for timer creation when available
2. Contextual adjustments will provide meaningful value across our target use cases
3. A one-time purchase model will be sustainable if on-device LLMs become viable
4. Local-first data approach with native sync will satisfy privacy concerns
5. Users will accept cloud-based processing for natural language understanding given the clear benefits

## FAQ

### General Product Questions
**Q: How does this differ from saying "Set a timer for 5 minutes" to Siri/Google Assistant?**  
A: While voice assistants handle simple timers well, our app shines with context-aware adjustments. For example, instead of saying "Set a timer for 6 minutes to boil an egg," users simply say "Set a timer to boil an egg" and the app automatically adjusts the duration based on location (e.g., 6 minutes in New York vs. 7 minutes in Denver's higher altitude). This contextual intelligence, combined with multi-timer management and routine tracking, creates a much more powerful timing experience.

**Q: What happens if the user is in a situation where voice input isn't appropriate?**  
A: The app includes a minimal visual interface with a drag-to-set clock and favorite routines accessible via swipe gestures.

**Q: Can the app function fully offline?**  
A: For MVP, the app requires connectivity for natural language processing, as we'll be using cloud-based LLMs to translate user goals (e.g., "Timer for soft-boiled eggs") into specific timer durations (e.g., 6 minutes). Basic timer functionality and saved routines will work offline, but new natural language timer creation will require connectivity until on-device LLMs become viable for integration in future versions.

### Technical Implementation Questions
**Q: How do we ensure accurate voice understanding without sending data to the cloud?**  
A: For MVP, we'll rely on cloud-based LLMs for natural language understanding, with clear privacy policies in place. In future iterations, we plan to transition toward on-device LLMs as the technology matures, reducing cloud dependency while maintaining accurate understanding.

**Q: What's the approach to handling device background states?**  
A: We'll use local notifications for timer completions when backgrounded, with optional awakening for critical phase transitions.

**Q: How will the knowledge base be structured and updated?**  
A: For MVP, the knowledge base will be a versioned local database updated through the app update mechanism. Later releases will implement a more dynamic update system decoupled from app updates, allowing for regular expansions of the knowledge base without requiring full app updates.

### Business Model Questions
**Q: Why limit free tier to one saved routine instead of time-limiting features?**  
A: This approach delivers real value while creating a natural upgrade moment. It avoids the typical "trial" feeling that leads to abandonment.

**Q: Are there plans for subscription features in the future?**  
A: Our primary business model is centered around one-time purchases. However, if capable on-device LLMs aren't available in a reasonable timeframe, we may need to introduce subscription options to offset the ongoing costs of cloud-based language model usage. We'll prioritize the development of on-device solutions to maintain our commitment to the one-time purchase model.

**Q: How will feature parity be maintained across iOS and Android?**  
A: We will start with iOS for MVP, then expand to Android in Phase 2 of our roadmap. We'll develop a core feature set that works identically across platforms, with platform-specific optimizations for voice and background handling.
